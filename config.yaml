offset: [0, 0, 0] # offset x,y,z to pull the point cloud around origin
nr_models: ...  # total number of models

# step 1: data collection
y_boundary: ...
x_boundary: ... # used to filter out images outside the working area

# step 4 and 6: segmentation and feature extraction
tree_area_dist: ... # determined to ensure each segment contains a single tree and collectively covers most of the input point cloud
removing_tree_radius: ... 

center_area: ...
expected_trunk_radius: ... # average radius of trunks, should be decided based on the dataset
expected_mean_tolerance: ... # depends on the accuracy of BEV, smaller when using GT BEV
slice_interval: ... # slice interval for feature extraction (gaussian fitting)

# step 7: loop alignment
icp_threshold: ... # vertical correctness - decrease the value if there's only partial overlapping between ground points / significant difference of density between diff. models
max_tree_pair_dist: ... # horizontal correctness - threshold for tree pairs detection, determined based on the density of trees

# step 8: batch alignment
similarity_threshold: ... # threshold for cutting edges with low error similarity

ver_ignore/hor_ignore: ... # True: ignore the corresponding alignment; False: apply alignment
